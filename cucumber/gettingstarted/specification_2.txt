	Scenario: the physical data of the most recent examination are given
		Given a patient with the social security number "93051822361"
		And on "2000-04-17" the patient had a length of 180 cm and a weight of 80000 gr
		And the patient is registered
		And on "2000-04-10" the patient had a length of 180 cm and a weight of 75000 gr but these data were added later
		When I ask for the details of the patient using his social security number
		Then the length 180, weight 80000, and date of the examination "2000-04-17â€œ are given
		And the calculated bmi 24.69 is based on these data
